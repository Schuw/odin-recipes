<h2>Instructions: </h2>
    <ol>
    <li><h3>Cook the Chicken </h3></li>
        <ol>
            <li>In a pot, cook the chicken breasts in water with a pinch of salt until fully cooked (about 15‚Äì20 minutes). </li>
            <li>Remove the chicken and shred it using two forks.</li>
            <li>Reserve 2 cups of the chicken broth for the dough.</li>
        </ol>
    <li><h3>Prepare the filling</h3></li>
        <ol>
            <li>In a pan, heat the olive oil and saut√© the chopped onion and garlic until soft.</li>
            <li>Add the shredded chicken, salt, pepper, and optional parsley. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and stir in the cream cheese. Set aside to cool.</li>
        </ol>
    <li><h3>Make the Dough</h3></li>
        <ol>
            <li>In a saucepan, bring the 2 cups of chicken broth and butter to a boil.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, add the flour all at once and stir vigorously until it forms a smooth, firm dough and pulls away from the sides of the pan.</li>
            <li>Let the dough cool slightly, then knead it on a clean surface until smooth</li>
        </ol>
    <li><h3>Shape the Coxinhas</h3></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Take a small portion of dough (about the size of a golf ball) and flatten it in your hand.</li>
            <li>Place a spoonful of chicken filling in the center.</li>
            <li>Fold the dough around the filling and shape it into a teardrop (thicker at the base and pointed at the top).</li>
        </ol>
    <li><h3>Bread the Coxinhas</h3></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Dip each coxinha into the beaten egg, then roll it in breadcrumbs to coat.</li>
        </ol>
    <li><h3>Fry Until Golden</h3></li>
        <ol>    
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Fry the coxinhas in batches until golden brown and crispy (about 3‚Äì4 minutes).</li>
            <li>Drain on paper towels.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Coxinhas can be frozen before frying. Just bread them and freeze on a tray, then transfer to a bag once solid. Fry straight from frozen when ready to eat. </p>
